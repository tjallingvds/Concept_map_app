## üåü Overview

Concept Map App is a web-based tool designed to help users create visual representations of knowledge and relationships between concepts. It's particularly useful for students, educators, researchers, and anyone looking to organize complex information in an intuitive way.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Concept Map Creation**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating nodes and connections
- **User Accounts**: Personal dashboard to manage your concept maps
- **Sharing and Collaboration**: Share your maps publicly or collaborate with specific users
- **Notes & Learn**: Create and manage study notes with rich text editing
- **Convert Notes to Concept Maps**: Automatically transform your notes into structured concept maps
- **Templates and Examples**: Get started quickly with pre-built templates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Export Options**: Save your maps in various formats (PNG, PDF, JSON)
- **Search Functionality**: Find public concept maps on topics of interest

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: 
  - React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
  - Built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, a collection of reusable, accessible, and customizable UI components
  - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
  - BlockNote for rich text editing in the Notes feature
- **Backend**: Python Flask API
- **Data Storage**: Currently uses in-memory storage (JSON), with plans to integrate a database system

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Python (v3.8+)
- pip

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tjallingvds/concept_map_app.git
   cd concept_map_app
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```bash
   cd concept-map/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:5173

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory
   ```bash
   cd concept-map/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. Run the server
   ```bash
   python run.py
   # or
   flask run
   ```

7. The API server should now be running at http://localhost:5001

### Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding values and make deployment to different environments easier:

#### Frontend Environment Variables (.env file)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The URL of the backend API server (default: http://localhost:5001)

#### Backend Environment Variables (.env file)
- `FLASK_APP`: The main Flask application file (default: app.py)
- `FLASK_ENV`: The environment to run Flask in (development/production)
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Enable/disable debug mode (1/0)
- `PORT`: The port to run the API server on (default: 5001)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for Google's Gemini model
- `FRONTEND_URL`: The URL of the frontend application (default: http://localhost:5173)

**Important**: Always use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoding URLs or other sensitive information in the codebase. This ensures the application can be deployed to different environments without code changes.

## üìã Tasks and Project Management

Project tasks, feature requests, and bug tracking are managed in our Notion workspace. You can find all current and upcoming tasks at:
